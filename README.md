A collection of quick programs for fun / to test out ideas

dreamcatcher.py
A general way to compare two people's rankings of something (demonstrated with Dreamcatcher's discography)

third asc proof.py
A program that convinced me a proof for my third research project was valid -- a process always terminates in a finite number of steps.

webscraping.py
Scrapes rateyourmusic.com/charts and makes a spotify playlist -- this was to test out selenium.webdriver which has proved useful in other places.
